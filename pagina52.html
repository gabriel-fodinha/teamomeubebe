            Ah, ah, ah, ah<br>
            <br>
            You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables<br>
            Left a small town, never looked back<br>
            I was a flight risk with a fear of falling<br>
            Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts<br>
            <br>
            I say: Can you believe it?<br>
            As we're lying on the couch<br>
            The moment I could see it<br>
            Yes, yes, I can see it now<br>
            <br>
            Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?<br>
            You put your arm around me for the first time<br>
            You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter<br>
            You are the best thing that's ever been mine<br>
            <br>
            Flash forward and we're taking on the world together<br>
            And there's a drawer of my things at your place<br>
            You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded<br>
            You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes<br>
            <br>
            But we got bills to pay<br>
            We got nothing figured out<br>
            When it was hard to take<br>
            Yes, yes, this is what I thought about<br>
            <br>
            Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?<br>
            You put your arm around me for the first time<br>
            You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter<br>
            You are the best thing that's ever been mine<br>
            <br>
            Do you remember, all the city lights on the water?<br>
            You saw me start to believe for the first time<br>
            You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter<br>
            You are the best thing that's ever been mine<br>
            <br>
            Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
            And I remember that fight, 2:30AM<br>
            As everything was slipping right out of our hands<br>
            And I ran out crying<br>
            And you followed me out into the street<br>
            <br>
            Braced myself for the goodbye<br>
            'Cause that's all I've ever known<br>
            Then you took me by surprise<br>
            You said: I'll never leave you alone<br>
            <br>
            You said: I remember how we felt sitting by the water<br>
            And every time I look at you is like the first time<br>
            I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter<br>
            She is the best thing that's ever been mine<br>
            <br>
            (Hold on, make it last)<br>
            (Hold on, never turn back)<br>
            You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (hold on)<br>
            You are the best thing that's ever been mine (hold on, hold on)<br>
            <br>
            Do you believe it? (Hold on)<br>
            We're gonna make it now (hold on, yeah)<br>
            And I can see it (hold on)<br>
            (Yeah, yeah, I can see it now, see it now)"
